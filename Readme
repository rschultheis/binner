This is a simple Ruby script for doing 'binning' which is putting numbers into bins.

Run it like this:
    ruby binner.rb [excel input file name]

for instance:
    ruby binner.rb data/November\ Measurements.xls


To setup:
- install ruby (requires 1.8.7 or higher, determine that by running 'ruby -v').  Note macs should have this already.
- install gems:
    bundle install
- that should be all
